- <b> Africa’s Urbanisation Dynamics 2025 - Planning for Urban Expansion </b> AfDB: https://www.afdb.org/en/documents/africas-urbanisation-dynamics-2025-planning-urban-expansion - *With    the    right    urban    planning,    governance    and    investment  strategies,  Africa’s  cities  can  become  hubs  of growth,  innovation  and  opportunity.  This  report  provides  the  most comprehensive view to date of Africa’s future urbanisation dynamics.  It  will  support  a  comprehensive  agenda  for  policy  makers, governments, development partners and international stakeholders.  By  planning  now,  Africa  can  manage  its  urban  growth   in   ways   that   promote   sustainability,   inclusivity   and   resilience, setting the stage for a prosperous urban future.*

### EU cooperation <a name="eu-accession"></a> 

- EU-Africa: Global Gateway Investment Package: https://international-partnerships.ec.europa.eu/policies/global-gateway/initiatives-sub-saharan-africa/eu-africa-global-gateway-investment-package_en
- <b> Strategic Corridors for an enhanced and greener EU-Africa connectivity </b> https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC128380 - *As part of the Global Gateway investment priorities, and in line with the African Union's Agenda 2063 and the ambitions of the African Continental Free Trade Area, the EU intends to support the African continent by financing quality connectivity infrastructure through multi-country Team Europe Initiatives shaped along Strategic Corridors. A limited number of Strategic Corridors has been identified considering their potentialities to facilitate sustainable, efficient, smart, resilient, fair, affordable, secure and safe mobility and trade within Africa, as well as between Africa and Europe.*
- <b> Identification, characterisation and ranking of strategic corridors in Africa </b> European Union: https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC128942 - *This report describes methods and outcomes of the first phase of the CUSA project: By employing more than 140 quantitative indicators, the project identified 55 strategic corridors along four policy scenarios: Strengthening Europe-Africa connectivity; Human development & peace and security; Green Deal; and Sustainable growth and jobs. A shortlist of 11 strategic corridors was obtained by analysing potential trade-offs across the four scenarios, focusing on 32 indicators related to economic welfare, equity, social inclusion, impact on the environment and impact on vulnerable groups.*

### Trade Facilitation <a name="trade-facilitation"></a> 

- Corridor Management
  - <b> Institutional Arrangements for Transport Corridor Management in Sub-Saharan Africa </b>  SSATP/World Bank: https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/dad26452-7dbe-5e7c-95c4-ae7bffb40434 - *This concept paper reviews the legal and institutional options for establishing corridor management groups and proposes a framework for establishing such groups along all major transport corridors. Some of the lessons have emerged from the existing corridor management arrangements: (i) corridor groups interventions are problem solving and the operational procedures should encourage this objective and retain flexibility necessary to be responsive; (ii) working groups can be formed on an ad hoc basis to address specific issues and disbanded once the objective met; and (iii) the group organization should ensure public-private interaction at all levels.*
  - <b> Cross-Border Road Corridors - Expanding Market Access in Africa and Nurturing Continental Integration >7>b AfDB: https://www.afdb.org/en/documents/cross-border-road-corridors-expanding-market-access-africa-and-nurturing-continental-integration - *This report documents the AfDBk Group’s wotk to expand road infrastructure especially cross-border transport corridors. Through its financing and investments, the AfDB is helping remove infrastructure bottlenecks, reducing barriers to cross-border trade and achieving regional integration. Between 2004 and 2022, the Bank provided over USD 13 billion to finance regional road corridor projects.

- <b> African Economic Outlook 2024 </b> AfDB: https://www.afdb.org/en/knowledge/publications/african-economic-outlook - *The theme of the 2024 African Economic Outlook is Driving Africa’s Transformation: The Reform of the Global Financial Architecture.*
- <b> The Missing Connection: Unlocking Sustainable Infrastructure Financing in Africa </b> NEPAD: https://nepad.org/publication/technical-white-paper-missing-connection-unlocking-sustainable-infrastructure - *This analysis highlights the gap between the rhetoric of the Global Gateway strategy and reality. Although the focus on infrastructure is positive and the aspiration to develop greater coherence with a ‘Team Europe’ approach is necessary, the results since 2021 have been mixed. Initial studies show there is strong political alignment between Global Gateway (and other foreign-funded projects) and Africa’s infrastructure goals. Yet, high level alignment does not necessarily translate into good operational coordination and implementation. There is a need for clear communication of the Global Gateway strategy across all key ecosystem stakeholders and ensuring ownership with Africa and European member states and businesses.*
- <b> Toward a Data-driven Understanding of Trade and Transport Corridors - An Assessment of the Potential of the Existing Transport Corridor Monitoring Systems to Foster Policy Dialogue and to Strengthen Corridor Management Institutions in Africa </b> World bank: https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/099062624065590055/p1747631502efe01918fc51d71b34b63f01 -*Developing guidance and tools to assess and monitor regional transport corridors performance is among the priority activities of the Africa Transport Policy Program Fourth Development Plan (SSATP-DP4) strategy. Corridor performance monitoring systems can be of significant value to corridor management institutions (CMIs), offering quick insights into the critical components that influence progress and transport within the corridors. In this paper, the advantages and limitations of three corridor monitoring instruments are examined. The study indicates that while all three monitoring systems have valuable data collection capabilities that are essential for supporting the sustainability and credibility of CMIs, the preference lies with a system capable of real-time data collection and immediate analysis of key corridor activities on a daily basis. Overall, this report highlights the potential benefits for CMIs if they integrate data analytics as a fundamental part of their activities.*
- <b> Overcoming the Barriers to Green, Resilient, Inclusive, and Efficient Regional Trade Corridors in Southern Africa </b> World Bank: https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/099061224103038438/p1747631dd2f8e060181481345dccd48b50 -*"The report is structured in the following way: The first section provides an overview of the condition of the physical infrastructure and some of the challenges in maintaining and improving the network. The second section looks at the projected growth" on the transport network up to 2050. The latter looks at the needs, and the complementarity between the corridors, given that growth under several defined scenarios. The third section is an assessment of the impact of climate change and the vulnerability of the regional trade and transport network under different scenarios. The fourth section looks at the enabling framework and reforms needed to improve regional trade, at the border and behind the border, with a more detailed exposition of the higher-level institutional framework for international trade provided in Annex E (Volume 2). The fifth section provides a summary of the oft-neglected social impacts of regional trade and transport. This is followed by a review of the challenges of funding the regional trade and transport network, in terms of the necessary recurrent and capital expenditure, and the potential for private finance. The final section provides a list of priority interventions in the physical infrastructure, their importance in terms of resilience, and the enabling reforms necessary to overcome the barriers to green, resilient inclusive and efficient regional trade and transport corridors in the southern Africa region.*
- <b> Spatial Development Initiatives – Potentials, Challenges and Policy Lessons With a Specific Outlook for Inclusive Agrocorridors in Sub-Saharan Africa </b> IDOS: https://www.idos-research.de/fileadmin/migratedNewsAssets/Files/Study__97..pdf - *The promotion of agrocorridors has gained increasing attention in discussions on attracting investments, stimulating agribusiness development, and addressing food insecurities and malnutrition in sub-Saharan Africa. Though agrocorridors are being widely talked about, very little empirical data exists on the economic performance and inclusiveness of agricultural corridor initiatives. Especially in sub-Saharan Africa, only a few, if any, implemented cases of integrated agrocorridors can be found. However, although agrocorridors constitute a new instrument to shape spatial economic development, other spatial development initiatives (SDIs) exist – that is, spatially-organised economic development schemes with the aim to develop business and investment environments in specific areas – that have longer track records. This report shows that SDIs are very difficult to get right. Several necessary but no sufficient conditions exist for success. Though the “island” approach of SDIs promises to address and remove various growth obstacles, evidence suggests that spatial approaches rarely deliver a considerably improved environment beyond what is available “outside” of a targeted area. Overall, it is shown that the economic and social performance of SDIs is inherently linked to the quality of the national investment climate.*
- <b> Institutional Arrangements for Transport Corridor Management in Sub-Saharan Africa </b> World Bak/SSATP: https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/dad26452-7dbe-5e7c-95c4-ae7bffb40434 -*This concept paper reviews the legal and institutional options for establishing corridor management groups and proposes a framework for establishing such groups along all major transport corridors. Some of the lessons have emerged from the existing corridor management arrangements: (i) corridor groups interventions are problem solving and the operational procedures should encourage this objective and retain flexibility necessary to be responsive; (ii) working groups can be formed on an ad hoc basis to address specific issues and disbanded once the objective met; and (iii) the group organization should ensure public-private interaction at all levels.*
-  <b> Logistics as the key to the development of sub-Saharan Africa: New paths for economic growth and sustainable employment </b> TU Berlin: https://www.tu.berlin/en/logistik/news-details/logistik-als-schluessel-zur-entwicklung-subsahara-afrikas-neue-wege-fuer-wirtschaftliches-wachstum-und-nachhaltige-beschaeftigung  - *The study analyses the current state of logistics in sub-Saharan African countries and highlights challenges that need to be overcome, including high logistics costs, inefficient processes, inadequate infrastructure and more. Country comparisons of Ethiopia, Rwanda and Ghana illustrate the specific logistics requirements for the region. The analyses also focus on the role of logistics in intra-African trade and the development of logistics corridors.*
