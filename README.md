- <b> Toward a Data-driven Understanding of Trade and Transport Corridors - An Assessment of the Potential of the Existing Transport Corridor Monitoring Systems to Foster Policy Dialogue and to Strengthen Corridor Management Institutions in Africa </b> World bank: https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/099062624065590055/p1747631502efe01918fc51d71b34b63f01 -*Developing guidance and tools to assess and monitor regional transport corridors performance is among the priority activities of the Africa Transport Policy Program Fourth Development Plan (SSATP-DP4) strategy. Corridor performance monitoring systems can be of significant value to corridor management institutions (CMIs), offering quick insights into the critical components that influence progress and transport within the corridors. In this paper, the advantages and limitations of three corridor monitoring instruments are examined. The study indicates that while all three monitoring systems have valuable data collection capabilities that are essential for supporting the sustainability and credibility of CMIs, the preference lies with a system capable of real-time data collection and immediate analysis of key corridor activities on a daily basis. Overall, this report highlights the potential benefits for CMIs if they integrate data analytics as a fundamental part of their activities.*
- <b> Overcoming the Barriers to Green, Resilient, Inclusive, and Efficient Regional Trade Corridors in Southern Africa </b> World Bank: https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/099061224103038438/p1747631dd2f8e060181481345dccd48b50 -*"The report is structured in the following way: The first section provides an overview of the condition of the physical infrastructure and some of the challenges in maintaining and improving the network. The second section looks at the projected growth" on the transport network up to 2050. The latter looks at the needs, and the complementarity between the corridors, given that growth under several defined scenarios. The third section is an assessment of the impact of climate change and the vulnerability of the regional trade and transport network under different scenarios. The fourth section looks at the enabling framework and reforms needed to improve regional trade, at the border and behind the border, with a more detailed exposition of the higher-level institutional framework for international trade provided in Annex E (Volume 2). The fifth section provides a summary of the oft-neglected social impacts of regional trade and transport. This is followed by a review of the challenges of funding the regional trade and transport network, in terms of the necessary recurrent and capital expenditure, and the potential for private finance. The final section provides a list of priority interventions in the physical infrastructure, their importance in terms of resilience, and the enabling reforms necessary to overcome the barriers to green, resilient inclusive and efficient regional trade and transport corridors in the southern Africa region.*
- <b> Spatial Development Initiatives ‚Äì Potentials, Challenges and Policy Lessons With a Specific Outlook for Inclusive Agrocorridors in Sub-Saharan Africa </b> IDOS: https://www.idos-research.de/fileadmin/migratedNewsAssets/Files/Study__97..pdf - *The promotion of agrocorridors has gained increasing attention in discussions on attracting investments, stimulating agribusiness development, and addressing food insecurities and malnutrition in sub-Saharan Africa. Though agrocorridors are being widely talked about, very little empirical data exists on the economic performance and inclusiveness of agricultural corridor initiatives. Especially in sub-Saharan Africa, only a few, if any, implemented cases of integrated agrocorridors can be found. However, although agrocorridors constitute a new instrument to shape spatial economic development, other spatial development initiatives (SDIs) exist ‚Äì that is, spatially-organised economic development schemes with the aim to develop business and investment environments in specific areas ‚Äì that have longer track records. This report shows that SDIs are very difficult to get right. Several necessary but no sufficient conditions exist for success. Though the ‚Äúisland‚Äù approach of SDIs promises to address and remove various growth obstacles, evidence suggests that spatial approaches rarely deliver a considerably improved environment beyond what is available ‚Äúoutside‚Äù of a targeted area. Overall, it is shown that the economic and social performance of SDIs is inherently linked to the quality of the national investment climate.*
