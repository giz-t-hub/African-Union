### National Vision, Strategy, Masterplan <a name="national-vision-strategy-masterplan"></a> 

- Transport

- General
  - <b> Study on Programme for Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA): Phase III Report Transport </b> 2011, https://www.nepad.org/publication/study-programme-infrastructure-development-africa-pida-phase-iii-report-energy - *The report covers four modes: road, rail, river and air. It was prepared at the Continental and
Regional (REC) levels.*

- SADC
  - <b> Regional Infrastructure Development Master Plan Transport Sector Plan 2012 </b> https://www.sadc.int/sites/default/files/2021-08/Regional_Infrastructure_Development_Master_Plan_Transport_Sector_Plan.pdf - *- AfDB:With infrastructure central to its goals of poverty eradication and Regional Integration, SADC developed the Regional Infrastructure Development Master Plan as a strategic framework guiding infrastructure development in Southern Africa. The Transport Sector Plan component of this Master Plan aims to identify key hubs for rehabilitation and development in order to improve the ability of passengers and goods to reach markets. The Sector Plan analyses the current situation in SADC regarding roads, rails, ports, waterways, and air transport, offering projections for the future and an assessment of gaps between the current situation and infrastructure goals for 2027. It then sets out a strategic framework for improvements to transport infrastructure, as well as an implementation strategy that prioritises projects, resource requirements, and methods of implementation. These improvements respond to a need for greater capacity along strategic transportation corridors as industry develops throughout Southern Africa.*

### EU cooperation <a name="eu-accession"></a> 

- EU-Africa: Global Gateway Investment Package: https://international-partnerships.ec.europa.eu/policies/global-gateway/initiatives-sub-saharan-africa/eu-africa-global-gateway-investment-package_en
- <b> Strategic Corridors for an enhanced and greener EU-Africa connectivity </b> https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC128380 - *As part of the Global Gateway investment priorities, and in line with the African Union's Agenda 2063 and the ambitions of the African Continental Free Trade Area, the EU intends to support the African continent by financing quality connectivity infrastructure through multi-country Team Europe Initiatives shaped along Strategic Corridors. A limited number of Strategic Corridors has been identified considering their potentialities to facilitate sustainable, efficient, smart, resilient, fair, affordable, secure and safe mobility and trade within Africa, as well as between Africa and Europe.*
- <b> Identification, characterisation and ranking of strategic corridors in Africa </b> European Union: https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC128942 - *This report describes methods and outcomes of the first phase of the CUSA project: By employing more than 140 quantitative indicators, the project identified 55 strategic corridors along four policy scenarios: Strengthening Europe-Africa connectivity; Human development & peace and security; Green Deal; and Sustainable growth and jobs. A shortlist of 11 strategic corridors was obtained by analysing potential trade-offs across the four scenarios, focusing on 32 indicators related to economic welfare, equity, social inclusion, impact on the environment and impact on vulnerable groups.*

### Trade Facilitation <a name="trade-facilitation"></a> 

- Corridor Management
  - <b> Institutional Arrangements for Transport Corridor Management in Sub-Saharan Africa </b>  SSATP/World Bank: https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/dad26452-7dbe-5e7c-95c4-ae7bffb40434 - *This concept paper reviews the legal and institutional options for establishing corridor management groups and proposes a framework for establishing such groups along all major transport corridors. Some of the lessons have emerged from the existing corridor management arrangements: (i) corridor groups interventions are problem solving and the operational procedures should encourage this objective and retain flexibility necessary to be responsive; (ii) working groups can be formed on an ad hoc basis to address specific issues and disbanded once the objective met; and (iii) the group organization should ensure public-private interaction at all levels.*
  - <b> Cross-Border Road Corridors - Expanding Market Access in Africa and Nurturing Continental Integration </b> AfDB: https://www.afdb.org/en/documents/cross-border-road-corridors-expanding-market-access-africa-and-nurturing-continental-integration - *This report documents the AfDBk Group’s wotk to expand road infrastructure especially cross-border transport corridors. Through its financing and investments, the AfDB is helping remove infrastructure bottlenecks, reducing barriers to cross-border trade and achieving regional integration. Between 2004 and 2022, the Bank provided over USD 13 billion to finance regional road corridor projects.

### Digitalisation <a name="digitalisation"></a>

- <b> Catching up on Digital Port Infrastructure for Africa </b> SSATP / World Bank: https://www.ssatp.org/publication/catching-digital-port-infrastructure-africa   - *This SSATP working paper examines the urgent need for digitalization of Africa’s port infrastructure in light of the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) mandatory Maritime Single Window (MSW) requirement, effective January 1, 2024. Despite this global mandate, many African countries remain in early stages of compliance, hindered by institutional, legal, and operational challenges. Drawing on interviews with maritime stakeholders and lessons from early adopters such as Ghana and Egypt, the paper outlines a pragmatic roadmap for MSW implementation. It provides a taxonomy of port digital systems, a stepwise strategy toward port call optimization, and a detailed implementation checklist tailored to the African context. Through coordinated policy action, stakeholder engagement, and targeted capacity building, African countries can leverage MSWs to enhance trade facilitation, improve port performance, and drive regional integration. This paper contributes practical guidance to policymakers, port authorities, and development partners supporting Africa’s digital transformation in the maritime sector.*

- <b> Trade and Infrastructure Integration in Africa </b> Lionel Gérard Fontagné, Mathilde Sylvie Maria Lebrand, Siobhan Murray, Michele Ruta, Gianluca Santoni: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5041658 - *Economic integration of the African continent rests on two pillars: the ratification of an ambitious trade agreement and massive investment in transportation infrastructure. Leveraging a newly created city-level database on African exporters' transport times, transport route optimization and general equilibrium modelling of international trade, the paper quantifies the impact of greater trade and transport integration for Africa. A pan-African agreement, such as the Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), would increase African countries' exports by an average of 3.5 percent and GDP by 0.27 percent. Complementing trade integration by reducing transportation time on roads, ports and border posts would increase exports by 7.15 percent and GDP by 0.72 percent. Major transport investments are necessary to fully reap the benefits of the AfCFTA.*
- <b> Negotiating development corridor projects in Africa - What governments may want to consider as corridors crisscross the continent </b> Richard Dion: https://www.brookings.edu/articles/negotiating-development-corridor-projects-in-africa/ - *Corridors—regional transportation and transmission networks—represent an immense development opportunity for Africa. Typically driven by mining, corridors can integrate regions, create economic opportunities for peripheral economies, and deliver goods globally. But there are several key issues African governments must closely consider when negotiating corridors with private and state investors.*
- <b> Connective financing: Chinese infrastructure projects and the diffusion of economic activity in developing countries </b> Richard Bluhm, Axel Dreher, 
Andreas Fuchs, Bradley C. Parks, Austin M. Strange, Michael J. Tierney: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119024001001?via%3Dihub - *Abstract: "This paper studies the causal effect of transport infrastructure on the spatial distribution of economic activity within subnational regions across a large number of developing countries. To do so, we introduce a new global dataset of geolocated Chinese grant- and loan-financed development projects from 2000 to 2014 and combine it with measures of spatial concentration based on remotely sensed data. We find that Chinese-financed transportation projects decentralize economic activity within regions, as measured by a spatial Gini coefficient, by 2.2 percentage points. The treatment effects are particularly strong in regions that are less developed, more urbanized, and located closer to cities."
- <b> Transport trade African-intra and infrastructure: A new empirical evidence </b>  Afreximbank: https://media.afreximbank.com/afrexim/APRWPS202411_Transport-infrastructure-and-intra-African-trade-A-new-empirical-evidence.pdf - *This study examines the effect of transport infrastructure on intra-African trade, both at the scale of the continent and in its different regions. Besides infrastructure development, the paper pays particular attention to infrastructure quality. The Generalized Method of Moment and the Poisson Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood estimators are used to obtain reliable results. The analysis covers all 54 African countries and the period 2003–2020. Robustness results obtained show that the development of transport infrastructure has a positive effect on intra-African trade. Regarding the quality of transport infrastructure, results put in evidence the positive effect on intra-African trade for the airport, port, and road infrastructures, but not for railways. On the regional level, there is a disparity of effects. Only transport infrastructures in Northern, Eastern and Southern Africa have a positive effect on intra-African trade.*
- <b> Mapping Africa’s Green Minerals Partnerships </b> https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-sr-4bS9l6auvZ8KF3Wim4AaIq7IQume/view - *Mapping Africa’s Green Mineral Partnerships delves into the evolving landscape of bilateral and multilateral agreements between African states and global powers concerning access to ‘critical’ or ‘green’ minerals. This report provides an in-depth analysis of twelve prominent global actors who have such partnerships with African states. These are: the United Kingdom, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Russia, India, China, South Korea, Japan, Indonesia, the United States and the European Union.*
- <b> Going beyond the Infrastructure Funding Gap: A South African Perspective Transport Sector Report </b> DBSA 2022 https://www.dbsa.org/sites/default/files/media/documents/2023-08/Beyond%20the%20Gap%20-%20Transport%20Sector%20Report%20-%202022.pdf  
- <b> China-Africa cooperation in the transport sector under the BRI </b> https://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/92562/3C_03.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y - *The goal of this study is to examine the difficulties involved in China-Africa transportation sector collaboration under the BRI. Through a thorough examination of China’s current investment in Africa’s transportation infrastructure, this paper aims to recognize the difficulties that China and Africa confront in their cooperation efforts. It then discusses suggestions that may be made to China and Africa to foster a deeper level of cooperation*
- <b> Sustainable Market Access for African Road Transport - Smart - Final Report </b> AfDB: https://www.afdb.org/en/documents/sustainable-market-access-african-road-transport-smart-final-report - *The Final Report of the SMART (Sustainable Market Access for African Road Transport) study is aimed at analysing the main regulatory and non-physical barriers that impede a streamlined movement of vehicles and goods within and between the different Regional Economic Communities (RECs) in Africa, and at providing recommendations in order to increase efficiency of cross-border road transport, reduce its costs, and maximize the economic benefits of the transport infrastructure, in view of reducing the cost of trad-ing across borders.*
- <b> African Economic Outlook 2024 </b> AfDB: https://www.afdb.org/en/knowledge/publications/african-economic-outlook - *The theme of the 2024 African Economic Outlook is Driving Africa’s Transformation: The Reform of the Global Financial Architecture.*
- <b> The Missing Connection: Unlocking Sustainable Infrastructure Financing in Africa </b> NEPAD: https://nepad.org/publication/technical-white-paper-missing-connection-unlocking-sustainable-infrastructure - *This analysis highlights the gap between the rhetoric of the Global Gateway strategy and reality. Although the focus on infrastructure is positive and the aspiration to develop greater coherence with a ‘Team Europe’ approach is necessary, the results since 2021 have been mixed. Initial studies show there is strong political alignment between Global Gateway (and other foreign-funded projects) and Africa’s infrastructure goals. Yet, high level alignment does not necessarily translate into good operational coordination and implementation. There is a need for clear communication of the Global Gateway strategy across all key ecosystem stakeholders and ensuring ownership with Africa and European member states and businesses.*
- <b> Toward a Data-driven Understanding of Trade and Transport Corridors - An Assessment of the Potential of the Existing Transport Corridor Monitoring Systems to Foster Policy Dialogue and to Strengthen Corridor Management Institutions in Africa </b> World bank: https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/099062624065590055/p1747631502efe01918fc51d71b34b63f01 -*Developing guidance and tools to assess and monitor regional transport corridors performance is among the priority activities of the Africa Transport Policy Program Fourth Development Plan (SSATP-DP4) strategy. Corridor performance monitoring systems can be of significant value to corridor management institutions (CMIs), offering quick insights into the critical components that influence progress and transport within the corridors. In this paper, the advantages and limitations of three corridor monitoring instruments are examined. The study indicates that while all three monitoring systems have valuable data collection capabilities that are essential for supporting the sustainability and credibility of CMIs, the preference lies with a system capable of real-time data collection and immediate analysis of key corridor activities on a daily basis. Overall, this report highlights the potential benefits for CMIs if they integrate data analytics as a fundamental part of their activities.*
- <b> Overcoming the Barriers to Green, Resilient, Inclusive, and Efficient Regional Trade Corridors in Southern Africa </b> World Bank: https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/099061224103038438/p1747631dd2f8e060181481345dccd48b50 -*"The report is structured in the following way: The first section provides an overview of the condition of the physical infrastructure and some of the challenges in maintaining and improving the network. The second section looks at the projected growth" on the transport network up to 2050. The latter looks at the needs, and the complementarity between the corridors, given that growth under several defined scenarios. The third section is an assessment of the impact of climate change and the vulnerability of the regional trade and transport network under different scenarios. The fourth section looks at the enabling framework and reforms needed to improve regional trade, at the border and behind the border, with a more detailed exposition of the higher-level institutional framework for international trade provided in Annex E (Volume 2). The fifth section provides a summary of the oft-neglected social impacts of regional trade and transport. This is followed by a review of the challenges of funding the regional trade and transport network, in terms of the necessary recurrent and capital expenditure, and the potential for private finance. The final section provides a list of priority interventions in the physical infrastructure, their importance in terms of resilience, and the enabling reforms necessary to overcome the barriers to green, resilient inclusive and efficient regional trade and transport corridors in the southern Africa region.*
- <b> Spatial Development Initiatives – Potentials, Challenges and Policy Lessons With a Specific Outlook for Inclusive Agrocorridors in Sub-Saharan Africa </b> IDOS: https://www.idos-research.de/fileadmin/migratedNewsAssets/Files/Study__97..pdf - *The promotion of agrocorridors has gained increasing attention in discussions on attracting investments, stimulating agribusiness development, and addressing food insecurities and malnutrition in sub-Saharan Africa. Though agrocorridors are being widely talked about, very little empirical data exists on the economic performance and inclusiveness of agricultural corridor initiatives. Especially in sub-Saharan Africa, only a few, if any, implemented cases of integrated agrocorridors can be found. However, although agrocorridors constitute a new instrument to shape spatial economic development, other spatial development initiatives (SDIs) exist – that is, spatially-organised economic development schemes with the aim to develop business and investment environments in specific areas – that have longer track records. This report shows that SDIs are very difficult to get right. Several necessary but no sufficient conditions exist for success. Though the “island” approach of SDIs promises to address and remove various growth obstacles, evidence suggests that spatial approaches rarely deliver a considerably improved environment beyond what is available “outside” of a targeted area. Overall, it is shown that the economic and social performance of SDIs is inherently linked to the quality of the national investment climate.*
- <b> Institutional Arrangements for Transport Corridor Management in Sub-Saharan Africa </b> World Bak/SSATP: https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/dad26452-7dbe-5e7c-95c4-ae7bffb40434 -*This concept paper reviews the legal and institutional options for establishing corridor management groups and proposes a framework for establishing such groups along all major transport corridors. Some of the lessons have emerged from the existing corridor management arrangements: (i) corridor groups interventions are problem solving and the operational procedures should encourage this objective and retain flexibility necessary to be responsive; (ii) working groups can be formed on an ad hoc basis to address specific issues and disbanded once the objective met; and (iii) the group organization should ensure public-private interaction at all levels.*

Country comparisons of Ethiopia, Rwanda and Ghana illustrate the specific logistics requirements for the region. The analyses also focus on the role of logistics in intra-African trade and the development of logistics corridors.*

### Data <a name="data"></a>

- <b> The African Development Corridors Database: a new tool to assess the impacts of infrastructure investments </b> Jessica P. R. Thorn, Diego Juffe Bignoli, Ben Mwangi & Robert A. Marchan: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01771-y - *The large-scale expansion of built infrastructure is profoundly reshaping the geographies of Africa, generating lock-in patterns of development for future generations. Understanding the impact of these massive investments can allow development opportunities to be maximised and therefore be critical for attaining the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals and African Union’s Agenda 2063 aims. However, until now information on the types, scope, and timing of investments, their evolution and spatial-temporal impact was dispersed amongst various agencies. We developed a database of 79 development corridors across Africa, synthesizing data from multiple sources covering 184 projects on railways, wet and dry ports, pipelines, airports, techno-cities, and industrial parks. The georeferenced interlinked tabular and spatial database includes 22 attributes. We expect this database will improve coordination, efficiency, monitoring, oversight, strategic planning, transparency, and risk assessments, among other uses for investment banks, governments, impact assessment practitioners, communities, conservationists, economists, and regional economic bodies.*
